This collection of tools is designed to assemble a cascading
bloom filter containing all TLS certificate revocations, as described
in this [CRLite paper.](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cbw/static/pdf/larisch-oakland17.pdf)

These tools were built from scratch, using the original CRLite research code as a design reference and closely following the documentation in their paper. 

## Dependancies
1. `ct-fetch` from [`ct-mapreduce`](https://github.com/jcjones/ct-mapreduce)
1. Python 3
2. Aria2c
4. Patience; many scripts take several hours even with multiprocessing

## Instructions
### Part A: Obtaining all Certificates
Use `ct-fetch` from [`ct-mapreduce`](https://github.com/jcjones/ct-mapreduce)
to fetch all certificates from CT logs.

### Part B: Determining CRL Revocations
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `cd get_CRL_revocations`
3. Edit `settings.py` `CT_FETCH_DATA_DIR` to point to the directory where you
   fetched the CT data in Part A.

The data pipeline for transforming CT log data into 2 final sets of "revoked"
and "non-revoked" certs is broken up into a number of processes. Each step
below creates an output that feeds into the next step.

4. `python extract_crls.py` loops over the `ct-fetch` data and outputs 2 files:
   * `certs_using_CRL.json` - all certificates which have listed CRLs
   * `CRL_servers.txt` - all CRL distribution points
5. `aria2c -d all_CRLs -i CRL_servers.txt -j 16` downloads all CRLs from 
   `CRL_servers.txt` into the
   * `all_CRLs/` directory
6. `python build_megaCRL.py` combines all the CRLs in `all_CRLs/` into a
   single:
   * `megaCRL.json`
7. `python build_CRL_revoked.py` parses `certs_using_crl.json` and puts any
   cert found in `megaCRL.json` into
   * `final_CRL_revoked.json` file
